# Project overview
## Background 
Traveling often poses challenges, especially in planning and managing travel routes. Travel support applications currently circulating in the community still do not provide an adequate level of personalization, making it difficult for users to get recommendations that are flexible and to their liking. This results in recommendations that are often irrelevant to the desired travel destination. TravelMate is here to answer this need with various features that offer travel planning solutions that can answer the above problems.
